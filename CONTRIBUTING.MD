# Contributing

If you happened to come across a bug or want to suggest a feature, feel free to [say something](https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/issues/new)!

If you'd like to contribute code, the steps below will help you get up and running.

## Elements naming

`Resource` or `@resource` is an instantiated `Avo::Resource` object.

`resource_name`: Pluralized, machine name, snake cased version of a resource. Ex: `resource_name` for `/avo/resources/team_memberships` path is going to be `TeamMemberships`.

`Model` or `@model`: Active Record `Model` object.

Since v `1.20` (Jan 2022) we started to change the `model` name with `record` where it fits. The `model` should be the class (ex: `User`, `Comment`, etc.) and `record` will be the instantiated model class with data (ex: `user` is a record when doing `user = User.find(1)`).

## Forking & branches

Please fork Avo and create a descriptive branch for your feature or fix. We usually use the `feature/`, `chore/`, or `fix/` branch prefixes. This way, the PR gets automatically labelled.

## Getting your local environment set up

NOTE: We're using `docker-compose` to run Postgres. While we find this incredibly helpful, it's not a requirement, but you'll have to BYOD (Bring Your Own Database).

Once you pull the code down to your machine, modify `spec/dummy/config/database.yml` as appropriate to your environment (no changes needed if you're using Docker).  Do not commit these changes.  From here, running `bin/init` will get you up-and-running.

# Local development

## Running the dummy app

From the root directory you can run `bin/dev` and that will start a foreman process for the rails server, jsbundling and cssbundling. Then, navigate to `localhost:3030` and enjoy the app.

## Seeding the database for local development

Run `AVO_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret bin/rails db:seed` to seed the database with dummy data and create a user for yourself with the email `admin@avohq.io` and password `secret`.


# Running tests

When running tests you have two options. 1. running them on your local database or 2. to use a database in a docker environment.

Run the migration script `bin/rails db:migrate`. Now you'll be able to run the test scripts below:

## Running tests with local database

Copy the `.env.test.sample` (`cp spec/dummy/.env.test.sample spec/dummy/.env.test`) and update it with the proper credentials for your local database. Run the migration script `bin/rails db:migrate`. Now you'll be able to run the test scripts below:

We've set up a few helpers to get you going:

- Run all tests (slow): `bin/test`
- Run unit tests (fast): `bin/test unit`
- Run system tests (slow): `bin/test system`
- Run a particular spec file/test (fast): `bin/test ./spec/features/hq_spec.rb`

## Running tests using the docker container

You may want to run the tests on your docker container. To do that, update your `.env.test` file with valid credentials for the docker setup like below. We do provide a `docker-compose.yml` file for the testing DB, so you can do `docker compose up`, but that's not our preferred method and you might need to do some tweaks. You'll then be able to run the migration script and the testing commands.

```
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5433
POSTGRES_USERNAME=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
```

# Release details

## Update appraisal gemfiles

We use [appraisal](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal) to run tests against multiple versions of rails. When the gemfile gets updated you must also run `bundle exec appraisal install` to update the versioned ones and commit them to the repo.
